# IoT-Based-Green-House-Monitoring-And-Control-System-
This project is an IoT-based Greenhouse Monitoring System that uses ESP32, DHT22, MQ135, and LDR sensors to track environmental conditions. The data is logged to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring, and relays are used to automate greenhouse controls. Ideal for smart farming and precision agriculture applications.
